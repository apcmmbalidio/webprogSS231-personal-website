        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Maria Sophea M. Balidio, but you can call me “P.” I’m the youngest of five in our family, and here are three facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I’m a huge fan of psychological thrillers, horror, and musicals. Cabaret is one of my all-time favorite films because it blends all three genres!</li>
            <li>I’m obsessed with music, especially R&B and mainstream pop. My playlist includes Ed Sheeran, NIKI, Ariana Grande, 5 Seconds of Summer, and Little Mix. I’ve started collecting vinyl records and already have four in my collection.</li>
            <li>I have six cats at home: Pitch, Patch, Panda, Riri, Selena, and Pepsi. Life with them is never dull.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy watching movies, series, and listening to music. Recently, I watched <em>Wicked</em> and cried during the movie for the first time. Currently, I’m watching the anime <em>Monsters</em> on Netflix, which tells the story of a doctor who sacrifices his license to save someone, only to discover that the person is a psychopath. I also enjoy reading books and recently finished <em>So B. It</em>, which I found exceptional.</p>
