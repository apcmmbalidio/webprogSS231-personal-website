        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Maria Sophea M. Balidio, but you can call me “P.” I’m the youngest of five in our family, and here are three facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I’m a huge fan of psychological thrillers, horror, and musicals. Cabaret is one of my all-time favorite films because it blends all three genres!
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                I’m obsessed with music, especially R&B and mainstream pop. My playlist includes Ed Sheeran, NIKI, Ariana Grande, 5 Seconds of Summer, and Little Mix. 
                <br> I’ve started collecting vinyl records and already have four in my collection.
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                I have six cats at home: Pitch, Patch, Panda, Riri, Selena, and Pepsi. Life with them is never dull.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>IT Experience</h2>
        <p>Before starting college, I didn’t have any IT experience. However, I began Harvard’s CS50 online course on edX, which provided a great introduction.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy watching movies, series, and listening to music. Recently, I watched *Wicked* and cried during the movie for the first time. Currently, I’m watching the anime *Monsters* on Netflix, which tells the story of a doctor who sacrifices his license to save someone, only to discover that the person is a psychopath. I also enjoy reading books and recently finished *So B. It*, which I found exceptional.</p>
