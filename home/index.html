            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy watching movies, series, and listening to music. Recently, I watched <em>Wicked</em> and cried during the movie for the first time. Currently, I’m watching the anime <em>Monsters</em> on Netflix, which tells the story of a doctor who sacrifices his license to save someone, only to discover that the person is a psychopath.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy reading books and recently finished <em>So B. It</em>, which I found exceptional.</p>
